# CourseDB
This is a Django based online system for managing a set of courses.  It covers tracking which courses are available, advertising specific dates on which courses will be run along with bookings and requests.  It will also eventually handle reminders and feedback to provide a complete system for running a training facility.

This system is still under development and isn't ready to be used yet.
